# 🫁 Lung Cancer Identification and Detection

This project aims to identify and detect lung cancer using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing medical data and predicting the likelihood of lung cancer in patients.

## 🔬 Project Overview

We use a dataset containing patient health information and apply multiple classification models to predict lung cancer presence. The models used include:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)

## 📊 Features

- Preprocessing of medical data
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy and performance comparison
- Confusion matrix and classification report visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains patient information like age, symptoms, smoking history, and diagnosis labels. (Mention the source if it's a public dataset)

## 🚀 Future Work

- Use deep learning models like CNNs with CT scan images
- Deploy as a web app for practical use
- Publish research paper based on results

## 📌 Note

This project is for educational and research purposes and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.
